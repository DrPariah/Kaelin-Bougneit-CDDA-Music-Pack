# Kaelin Bougneit CDDA Music Pack

This music pack is designed for use with Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, a post-apocalyptic zombie survival game, found here: https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA. It's still very WIP and may be updated occasionally in the future.

The background tracks (inspired by Lustmord, zoviet*france, and SleepResearch_Facility) are designed to be as unobtrusive as possible. You can hear more melodic, foreground tracks (pretty openly imitating Boards of Canada) in the vacinity of stereo systems or while listening to MP3 players in the game.

You can find other ambient music on my Bandcamp page: https://kaelinbougneit.bandcamp.com/
Other music of mine can be found on my label: https://music.subviolet.com/music
