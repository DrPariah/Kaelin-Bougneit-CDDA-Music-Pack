# Kaelin Bougneit CDDA Music Pack

This music pack is designed for use with **Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead**, a post-apocalyptic zombie survival game, found here: https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA. It's still very WIP and will be updated occasionally in the future.

The background tracks *(inspired by Lustmord, zoviet france, and SleepResearch_Facility)* are designed to be as unobtrusive as possible. You can hear more melodic, foreground tracks *(pretty openly imitating Boards of Canada)* in the vacinity of stereo systems or while listening to MP3 players in the game.

## Installation

1. Download this repo. 
2. Find your CDDA folder. If you're using a launcher, this may be in your Documents. Otherwise it's the folder you launch CDDA from. 
3. Find your current in-game soundpack and navigate to its associated folder (usually something like data/sound/Basic <- Basic is the default).
4. (Optional) Back up your soundpacks.
5. Delete any music files referenced in your current 'musicset.json', then delete your current 'musicset.json'. If you use a custom soundpack, it's likely this is all found in a 'music' folder for your convenience. 
6. Paste the contents of this repo into the soundpack. This music pack is now integrated with your chosen soundpack.
